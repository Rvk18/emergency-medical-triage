# Frontend

All client applications for Emergency Medical Triage live here, segregated by platform:

| Folder | Platform | Owner |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **web/** | Web dashboard (Next.js / Vite, TypeScript) | Web team |
| **mobile-android/** | Android app (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose) | Mobile team |

- Do not mix web and mobile code across these folders.
- Shared design docs and checklists are in `../docs/frontend/`.
